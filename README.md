# VASO File Upload

This is Virginia Science Olympiad’s facility for collecting files from competitors during tournaments.  It runs as a service on a virtual machine in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).  It presents a simple Web interface that competitors use to enter their identifying information (team number, school name, and so on) and upload their files.  The files are stored in an AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket for retrieval by event supervisors.

## Deploying the Service in EC2

Create a bucket.  This is currently called “virginia-science-olympiad” in the “us-east-1” (Northern Virginia) region, though the bucket name and region are configurable in `application.yml`.

Create two IAM groups, “VasoFileUploaders” and “VasoFileUploadReaders”.  Attach the policy “AdministratorAccess” to the first and attach “AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess” to the second.

Create one IAM profile in the VasoFileUploaders group and install it in the server’s `~/.aws` directory.  The service will use this profile to write to the bucket.  The name of the profile is configurable in `application.yml`.  _(TODO: Figure out the minimum permissions needed for this profile.)_

Create one IAM profile in VasoFileUploadReaders for each person who needs to retrieve files from the bucket.  Typically these people will be event supervisors, and perhaps a score master as well.  Instructions are below for these people to set up Cyberduck to retrieve their files.

Create and start an EC2 instance:

- Amazon Linux 2 AMI, either ARM or x86
- `a1.xlarge` for tournament day, `t2.micro` for free tier.
- EBS storage: 8 or 10 GB
- In the Security Group configuration, it should have SSH (port 22) access by default.  Add HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) as well.
- Accept defaults everywhere else
- When you finish the process, you will be given the option to create a new key pair.  If you have a key pair already, go ahead and select it.  Otherwise, give your new key pair a name, download it and save the `.pem` file.  Setting up your SSH client to use this key depends on what system you are using.  On Macintosh, UNIX, or Linux, save the file in your `~/.ssh` directory with `u=rw,go=` permissions.  On Windows, you’ll need to convert the `.pem` file to Putty’s format and then set up your Putty configuration to use the key when connecting to the server.  The remainder of these instructions assume you are using the command line SSH client on Mac, UNIX, or Linux.

To connect: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/<key-pair-file-name>.pem <ec2-public-dns-name>`

To transfer files: `sftp -i ~/.ssh/<key-pair-file-name>.pem <ec2-public-dns-name>`

Connect to the instance via SSH and set up some basic user configuration:

- Set up `~/.bashrc` and `~/.vimrc` according to your preferences
- Create the `~/.aws` directory and set the permissions on it to `u=rwx,go=`
- Create `~/.aws/config` with `u=rw,go=` permissions:

>> ```
>> [profile <iam-profile-name>]
>> region = us-east-1
>> ```

- Create `~/.aws/credentials` with `u=rw,go=` permissions:

>> ```
>> [<iam-profile-name>]
>> aws_access_key_id = <from-iam-profile>
>> aws_secret_access_key = <from-iam-profile>
>> ```

Install required software with these commands:

```
sudo yum update
sudo yum install java-11-amazon-corretto-headless
sudo yum install httpd
sudo yum install mod_ssl
```

Acquire a web site certificate.  I used the host name `file-upload.virginiaso.org` and the certificate issuer https://sslforfree.com/.  (I believe Microsoft also provides free certificates, though I haven’t tried them myself.)  Upload the certificate package to the EC2 instance.  The `~/.ssh` directory is a handy place to store it, since it has appropriate permissions.

Create the `/etc/certs` directory and unzip the certificate package there.  You should end up with three files, named something like `ca_bundle.crt`, `certificate.crt`, and `private.key`.  Run these commands:

```
sudo chmod u=rw,go= /etc/certs/*
sudo chown root.root /etc/certs/*
```

Upload the file `redirect_http.conf` from the git repository to `/etc/httpd/conf.d`.  (You will likely need to upload to your home directory and then move the file using `sudo`.)  Make sure that file contains correct paths to the three certificate files.

Restart the web server to pick up the new SSL configuration with this command:

```
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

Build the file upload service jar with the command `./gradlew clean build`.  (Issue this command in your git working directory, not on the EC2 instance.)  Then upload the jar from the `build/lib` directory to the EC2 instance, in your home directory.  Start the file upload service with this command:

```
java -jar VasoFileUpload-<version>-SNAPSHOT.jar &
```

Shut down the service like so:

```
ps -ef | grep VasoFileUpload | grep -v grep
kill <first-number-from-output-of-previous-command>
```

The final piece of configuration is to direct the host name `file-upload.virginiaso.org` to the new server.  To do this, log into the VASO iPage account, click on the `virginiaso.org` domain, click on “DNS & Nameservers” in the left-hand menu, and click on “DNS RECORDS.”  Add a DNS record with the following parameters:

Parameter   | Value
----------- | -------------
Name:       | file-upload
Type:       | A
IP Address: | The EC2 instance’s _public_ IP address
TTL:        | 1 hour
Priority:   | Leave blank

Once that takes effect, both http://file-upload.virginiaso.org/ and https://file-upload.virginiaso.org/ should display the file upload service’s index page.

## Configuration

The file upload service is configured via two files, `application.yml` and `tournamentConfig.yaml`.  Relevant settings in the former are discussed in the deployment section above.  Documentation for the latter still needs to be written.



## Retrieving the Files

The file upload server stores the files that competitors submit in “the cloud.”  More specifically, the files are stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3).  However, because they are behind several layers of security, it takes a bit of effort to gain access to them.  There are two ways to get the files.

### Method 1: Cyberduck (Recommended)

Cyberduck is free software for managing files over several kinds of remote connections, which you can download from https://cyberduck.io/download/.  Install it, start it up, and use the Open Connection command.  (This is under the File menu on the Mac -- not sure where it is on Windows.)  Change the connection type to Amazon S3 and leave the server and port set to their default values of `s3.amazonaws.com` and `443`.  Enter your access key ID and secret access key, and press Connect.  At this point you should see a folder hierarchy starting at `virginia-science-olympiad` and the rest should be pretty obvious, similar to a Finder window (on Mac) or File Explorer (on Windows).

### Method 2: AWS S3 Console

Point your browser at https://363197948456.signin.aws.amazon.com/console and log in.  The first time it will ask you to change your password.  Once you are logged in, you can navigate the folder hierarchy.  This method is nice in that you don’t need to install any software, but it’s clunkier, and you can only download files one at a time.

### The File Layout

The files are arranged as follows:

```
virginia-science-olympiad
   vaso-file-upload
      <event-name>-<division>
         List of files
         <event-name>-<division>-submissions.csv
```

Each file name has been constructed from the file name given by the competitors and the identifying information they entered in the upload form.  For example, if team B47 is the 17<sup>th</sup> team to upload their file in Vehicle Design, and their file was called `design.pdf`, then the file in S3 will be located in the folder `vehicleDesign-B` and it will be called `B47-design-017a.pdf`.  The team number is prepended to the file name, and the upload ordinal is appended afterwards.  The “a” after the ordinal indicates that it’s the first file on the form.  Vehicle Design and WICI only ask for one file, so they will always be “a”.  For Helicopter, the “a” file is the flight log and the “b” file is the video.  For Detector Design, the “a” file is the design log and the “b” file is the program code.

Each event folder also contains one special file called `<event-name>-<division>-submissions.csv`.  This is a CSV (spreadsheet file) that contains the form entries.  Each upload is one row in the file, with the following column headings:

- EVENT: The event name
- ID: The ordinal number appended to the file name
- VA_DATE_TIME: The date and time of the upload, in Eastern standard time.  This is formatted to that Excel will understand it properly.
- DIVISION
- TEAM_NUMBER
- SCHOOL_NAME
- TEAM_NAME
- STUDENT_NAMES
- NOTES: A free text field for the students to use to communicate unusual circumstances
- HELICOPTER_MODE: Used only in Helicopter
- FLIGHT_DURATION: Used only in Helicopter
- PASS_CODE: Used only in Helicopter
- LOAD_ESTIMATE: Used only in Digital Structures
- FILE_NAME_0: The first file name
- FILE_NAME_1: The second file name, if there is one
- FILE_NAME_2 through FILE_NAME_9: Unused
- UTC_TIME_STAMP: The same value as VA_DATE_TIME, except in UTC.  This is for the benefit of the server program -- you can safely ignore it.

There are a few differences for the Helicopter event.  For most events, the students visit the upload form only once, at the end of the event.  But for Helicopter, they visit twice, once at the beginning to get their unique word, and again at the end to upload their two files.  In S3, what you will see is two folders called helicopterStart and helicopterFinish.  The first will contain only a CSV file, in which you will find team identifying information, their start time, and their unique word (in the PASS_CODE column).  The second folder will contain a CSV file and the uploaded flight logs and videos.  The rows in these two CSV files will not be in the same order, so you will need to correlate the two files in order to verify their unique word and check their upload time. Team numbers and pass codes will be your best tools for performing this correlation, but you will need to apply some human smarts to be sure separate flights from the same team are lined up properly.

The HELICOPTER_MODE column will be set to one of the following values in the
second CSV:

- TWO_HELICOPTERS_TWO_STUDENTS_TWO_VIDEOS
- TWO_HELICOPTERS_ONE_STUDENT_TWO_VIDEOS
- ONE_HELICOPTER_ONE_STUDENT_TWO_VIDEOS

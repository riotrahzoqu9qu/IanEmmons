		Instructions:
		<ul>
			<li>
				The purpose of this form is to collect your Estimated Load Supported,
				which is used to break ties.
			</li>
			<li>
				Before you submit this form, you must visit the
				<span th:text="${event.label}"/> test in Scilympiad.  That test has no
				actual questions, but it contains important instructions and the two
				unknown construction parameters, minimum distance from wall to load and
				minimum contact width.
			</li>
			<li>
				This form must be submitted within five (5) minutes of starting the test
				in Scilympiad.  Then you should log into SkyCiv, start competition mode,
				and build your boom.
			</li>
			<li>
				Leave the test open in Scilympiad.  This will let you refer to the
				instructions there, and it will also give you access to the chat with
				the event supervisor in case there is an announcement or you need to ask
				a question.
			</li>
